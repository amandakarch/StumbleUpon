Semester-long project for Case Studies in Business Analytics course at Babson - based on a Kaggle competition, where the objective was to predict whether a website would be "evergreen" or not (ie. the content would be relevant forever), based on a variety of input variables.

Collaborated with a team of Babson students, mentioned in the written PDF.
